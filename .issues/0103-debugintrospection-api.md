# Debug/Introspection API

## Description
Add an API to inspect intermediate layout state (flex lines, track sizes, item measurements) for debugging purposes. Add debug result types to Algorithm.lean and create new Debug.lean module. Effort: Medium

## Progress
- [2026-02-02T05:33:36] Closed: Added Debug/Introspection API with structured flex/grid debug data, layoutDebug entry point, and README examples; lake test passes.
