# Structured Test Data Capture

## Description
Add ability to capture and export test results in structured formats (JSON, JUnit XML). CI/CD integration often requires structured test output for reporting tools, dashboards, and trend analysis. Affected files: new Crucible/Export.lean for test result serialization.
