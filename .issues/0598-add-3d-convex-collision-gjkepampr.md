# Add 3D convex collision (GJK/EPA/MPR)

## Description
3D support for convex collision queries with penetration depth/MTV; 2D GJK exists in Linalg/Geometry/Collision2D.lean.

## Progress
- [2026-02-02T03:03:00] Closed: Added 3D Support3D typeclass, GJK/EPA collision, MPR wrapper, and tests for 3D convex intersection.
