# Afferent demos: visualize convex decomposition pieces

## Description
Add a demo scene to render convex decomposition pieces from linalg, showing per-piece hulls/bounds and toggleable parameters.

## Progress
- [2026-02-02T08:02:25] Added convex decomposition demo scene with presets, hull/bounds rendering, and interactive controls.
- [2026-02-02T08:02:28] Closed: Added convex decomposition demo and tab with presets, hull/bounds rendering, and controls; tests passing.
