# Expand Test Coverage

## Description
Tests cover basic functionality but lack coverage for: edge cases (empty events, zero subscribers), combinator interactions, error conditions, and memory leak scenarios. Add tests for all combinators in Event.lean and Behavior.lean, stress tests for subscription management, and tests for complex network topologies.
