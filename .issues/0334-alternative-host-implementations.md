# Alternative Host Implementations

## Description
Add alternative host implementations beyond Spider: 1) Pure/test host for deterministic testing without IO, 2) Async host with proper concurrency support, 3) Single-threaded host optimized for UI frameworks. Would benefit from cleaner separation of host-agnostic abstractions.

## Progress
