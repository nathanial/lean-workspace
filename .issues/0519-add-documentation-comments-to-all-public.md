# Add Documentation Comments to All Public APIs

## Description
Many public functions lack documentation comments. Add docstrings to all public def and structure declarations throughout all modules, particularly Query/Executor.lean, Pull/Executor.lean, DSL/*.lean. Document parameters, return values, and usage examples. Medium effort.
