# Migrate KDTreeNearestNeighbor to MathView2D

## Description
Update afferent-demos Demos/Linalg/KDTreeNearestNeighbor.lean to use Afferent.Widget.MathView2D for grid/axes/labels and world-to-screen transforms.

## Progress
- [2026-02-02T21:08:46] Migrated KDTreeNearestNeighbor to MathView2D and updated view transforms.
- [2026-02-02T21:08:46] Closed: KDTreeNearestNeighbor now uses MathView2D for grid/axes/labels and view transforms; input handling updated where applicable.
