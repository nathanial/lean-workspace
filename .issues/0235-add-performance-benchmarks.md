# Add performance benchmarks

## Description
No performance benchmarks exist to catch regressions or measure improvements.

Action required:
1. Create benchmark suite for common operations
2. Benchmark many with different input sizes
3. Compare with manual parsing for reference
4. Add CI integration for performance tracking

Affected: New SiftBench/ directory

Effort: Medium
