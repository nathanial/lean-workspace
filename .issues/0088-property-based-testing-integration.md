# Property-Based Testing Integration

## Description
Add hooks or utilities for integrating with property-based testing libraries like plausible. Some projects already use plausible (tincture, chroma). The collimator tests show manual property testing patterns that could be formalized. Affected files: new Crucible/Property.lean for property test helpers and assertions. Optional dependency on plausible.
