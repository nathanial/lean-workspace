# MathView2D widget (axes/grid/labels)

## Description
Provide a reusable 2D math view widget with configurable axes, grid, tick marks, labels, and world<->screen transforms to simplify linalg demos.

## Progress
- [2026-02-02T20:20:32] Implemented MathView2D widget and added Afferent.Widget import.
- [2026-02-02T20:20:36] Closed: Implemented MathView2D widget and exported it via Afferent.Widget. Build succeeded; tests failed to link due to missing system frameworks on this machine.
