# Afferent demos: concavity metric & voxel sampling visualization

## Description
Visualize concavity heatmap and voxel/point sampling used by convex decomposition; include UI toggles for resolution/thresholds.

## Progress
- [2026-02-02T19:26:39] Added concavity heatmap + voxel/triangle sampling visualization with toggles, resolution/threshold controls, and updated UI/help text. Added hull-plane distance + point-in-mesh sampling for concavity.
- [2026-02-02T19:26:42] Closed: Implemented concavity heatmap and voxel/point sampling visualization with toggles for resolution/thresholds; updated demo UI controls.
