# Add Module-Level Documentation

## Description
While there are file-level doc comments, the overall architecture and usage patterns are not well documented. Add comprehensive module docstrings, document the relationship between Core, Macros, and SuiteRegistry, and add usage examples in doc comments. Location: all source files. Small effort.
