# Transaction Functions

## Description
Allow custom functions to run within transactions for complex multi-step operations with validation. Enables increment/decrement operations, compare-and-swap patterns, custom validation logic, conditional transactions. New file: Ledger/Tx/Functions.lean. Modify: Tx/Types.lean, Db/Database.lean. Large effort.
