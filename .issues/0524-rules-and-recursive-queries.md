# Rules and Recursive Queries

## Description
Implement Datalog rules for defining derived relationships and recursive queries. Enables powerful graph queries like 'find all ancestors' or 'compute transitive closure'. New file: Ledger/Query/Rules.lean. Modify: Query/AST.lean, Query/Executor.lean. Large effort.
