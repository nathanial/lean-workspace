# Polygon boolean ops + offsetting

## Description
2D polygon union/intersection/difference, clipping, and offset/buffering operations; complements Polygon2D triangulation.

## Progress
- [2026-02-02T04:03:50] Closed: Added Polygon2D boolean ops (intersection/union/difference) using Greiner-Hormann and added polygon offset; added tests.
