# Vector/Arrow field widget

## Description
Reusable widget to render vector fields (2D/3D) with arrows, magnitude coloring, and sampling controls for linalg demos.

## Progress
- [2026-02-03T04:23:38] Added VectorField widget module with 2D/3D render helpers and color ramps; updating vector field demo to use new draw helper.
- [2026-02-03T04:27:17] Closed: Implemented VectorField widget module (2D/3D) with sampling, magnitude coloring, and arrow styling; updated vector field demo to use shared draw helper and color scale.
