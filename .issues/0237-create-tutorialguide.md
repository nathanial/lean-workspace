# Create tutorial/guide

## Description
Users new to parser combinators need a tutorial explaining concepts, not just API reference.

Action required:
1. Write a progressive tutorial starting with simple parsers
2. Include a complete worked example (e.g., JSON parser)
3. Explain common patterns and pitfalls

Affected: New docs/ directory or expanded README

Effort: Medium
