# Add Property-Based Tests

## Description
Current tests are example-based. Property-based tests would provide better coverage for edge cases. Examples: Total width of flex items equals container width when all items have grow > 0, Grid items never overlap, Layout positions are always non-negative. Depends on plausible library. Effort: Medium
