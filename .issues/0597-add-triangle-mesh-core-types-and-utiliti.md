# Add triangle mesh core types and utilities

## Description
Mesh structure (vertex/index), adjacency/half-edge, normals/tangents, bounds, ray-mesh queries, optional mesh-specific BVH build helpers.

## Progress
- [2026-02-02T03:02:57] Closed: Implemented Mesh core types/utilities, adjacency/half-edge, ray casting, and Mesh BVH helpers; added tests.
