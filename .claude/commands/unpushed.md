# Check Unpushed Commits

Find projects with commits that haven't been pushed to origin.

## Instructions

1. Run `just unpushed` to find projects with unpushed commits
2. For each project with unpushed work, show:
   - Project name and location
   - Number of commits ahead of origin
   - Brief summary of unpushed commits
3. Recommend next steps (push, or review changes first)

## Example Usage

```
/unpushed
```
