<p>Subscriptions are automatically managed through <code>SubscriptionScope</code>. When you create
derived events or dynamics in SpiderM, their subscriptions are registered with the current scope.</p>

<h4>Hierarchical Cleanup</h4>
<pre><code class="language-lean">let scope ← SubscriptionScope.new

-- Register cleanup action
scope.register someUnsub

-- Create child scope (disposed when parent is disposed)
let child ← scope.child

-- Dispose all (children first, then parent's registrations)
scope.dispose</code></pre>

<p>SpiderM tracks a <code>currentScope</code> - all combinators automatically register their
subscriptions, so cleanup happens correctly when the scope is disposed.</p>

<h4>Best Practice</h4>
<p>Let SpiderM manage scopes automatically. Manual scope management is only needed for
advanced patterns like dynamically created/destroyed reactive subnetworks.</p>
