# Scene/Chapter Rename Inline

**Priority:** Medium
**Section:** Feature Proposals
**Estimated Effort:** Small
**Dependencies:** None

## Description
Allow renaming chapters and scenes directly in the navigation panel.

## Rationale
Currently chapters and scenes are created with generic names ("Chapter 1", "Scene 1") and there is no way to rename them. Users need to be able to give meaningful titles.

## Affected Files
- `/Users/Shared/Projects/lean-workspace/enchiridion/Enchiridion/UI/Update.lean`
- `/Users/Shared/Projects/lean-workspace/enchiridion/Enchiridion/State/AppState.lean`
