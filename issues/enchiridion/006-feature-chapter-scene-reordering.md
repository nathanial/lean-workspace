# Chapter/Scene Reordering

**Priority:** Medium
**Section:** Feature Proposals
**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Dependencies:** None

## Description
Allow drag-and-drop style reordering of chapters and scenes via keyboard.

## Rationale
Story structure often changes during writing. Currently there is no way to reorder chapters or scenes without deleting and recreating them.
