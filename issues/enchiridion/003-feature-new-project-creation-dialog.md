# New Project Creation Dialog

**Priority:** High
**Section:** Feature Proposals
**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Dependencies:** None

## Description
Add ability to create a new project with custom title and author from the UI.

## Rationale
Currently the application always starts with a hardcoded sample project ("The Great Adventure"). Users should be able to create new projects with their own titles.

## Affected Files
- `/Users/Shared/Projects/lean-workspace/enchiridion/Enchiridion/UI/App.lean`
- `/Users/Shared/Projects/lean-workspace/enchiridion/Enchiridion/UI/Draw.lean`
- `/Users/Shared/Projects/lean-workspace/enchiridion/Enchiridion/UI/Update.lean`
