# Scene Outline/Summary View

**Priority:** Medium
**Section:** Feature Proposals
**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Dependencies:** None

## Description
Add a bird's-eye view showing all scene synopses in a condensed format.

## Rationale
Writers often need to see the overall story structure at a glance. The current navigation only shows titles, not synopses.

## Affected Files
- `/Users/Shared/Projects/lean-workspace/enchiridion/Enchiridion/UI/Draw.lean`
- `/Users/Shared/Projects/lean-workspace/enchiridion/Enchiridion/State/Focus.lean` (new panel/mode)
- `/Users/Shared/Projects/lean-workspace/enchiridion/Enchiridion/UI/Layout.lean`
