# Animation Easing Library

**Priority:** Medium
**Section:** Feature Proposals
**Estimated Effort:** Small
**Dependencies:** None

## Description
Add a library of standard easing functions (ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, cubic-bezier, spring) for animations.

## Rationale
The framework has robust animation support (animated rendering, time-based loops) but lacks high-level easing utilities.

## Affected Files
- New file: `Afferent/Animation/Easing.lean`
- Integration with existing animation demos
