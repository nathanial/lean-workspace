# Progress Bar Variants

**Priority:** Low
**Section:** Feature Proposals
**Estimated Effort:** Small
**Dependencies:** None

## Description
Add additional progress bar styles: spinner with text, indeterminate progress, multi-step progress.

## Rationale
The current Gauge widget is good for determinate progress. Additional variants would cover more use cases.

## Affected Files
- `/Users/Shared/Projects/lean-workspace/terminus/Terminus/Widgets/Gauge.lean` (or new file)
