# Color Quantization / Palette Extraction

**Priority:** Medium
**Section:** Feature Proposals
**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Dependencies:** None

## Description
Implement algorithms to extract dominant colors from a set of colors (e.g., median cut, k-means clustering). This is useful for extracting color palettes from images.

## Rationale
Common use case for design tools and image processing.
