# Add Module-Level Documentation Comments

**Priority:** Low
**Section:** Code Cleanup
**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Dependencies:** None

## Description
While individual functions have doc comments, module-level documentation explaining the purpose and usage of each file is minimal.

## Rationale
Add comprehensive doc comments at the top of each file explaining:
- Purpose of the module
- Key types and functions
- Usage examples
- Any important caveats

## Affected Files
- All source files
