# Update README to Match Current Features

**Priority:** Medium
**Section:** Code Cleanup
**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Dependencies:** None

## Description
The README.md is minimal and does not reflect the full feature set of the library. It mentions only RGBA and HSV but the library supports 10+ color spaces, color blindness simulation, WCAG contrast, gradients, palettes, etc.

## Rationale
Update README with:
- Complete feature list
- Examples for each major feature area
- API documentation or links to generated docs

## Affected Files
- `/Users/Shared/Projects/lean-workspace/tincture/README.md`
