# CSS Color Level 4 Parsing Support

**Priority:** High
**Section:** Feature Proposals
**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Dependencies:** None

## Description
Extend the color parsing to support modern CSS Color Level 4 syntax including `hsl()`, `hwb()`, `lab()`, `lch()`, `oklab()`, `oklch()`, and the `color()` function.

## Rationale
CSS Color Level 4 is increasingly adopted in browsers. Supporting these formats would make Tincture more useful for web development workflows and CSS tool integration.
