# Common Widget Library

**Priority:** High
**Section:** Feature Proposals
**Estimated Effort:** Large
**Dependencies:** Theme System, Focus Management System

## Description
Provide pre-built, themed versions of common UI widgets: buttons, text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, sliders, dropdowns, dialogs, and tooltips.

## Rationale
Arbor provides primitive building blocks (text, box, flex, grid). Every application currently rebuilds common widgets from scratch. Canopy should provide a consistent set of ready-to-use components.

## Affected Files
- `Canopy/Widgets/Button.lean` (new)
- `Canopy/Widgets/TextField.lean` (new)
- `Canopy/Widgets/Checkbox.lean` (new)
- `Canopy/Widgets/Radio.lean` (new)
- `Canopy/Widgets/Slider.lean` (new)
- `Canopy/Widgets/Dropdown.lean` (new)

- `Canopy/Widgets/Tooltip.lean` (new)
