# Add Documentation for Core Profunctor Abstractions

**Priority:** Medium
**Section:** Code Improvements
**Estimated Effort:** Small
**Dependencies:** None

## Description
The `Collimator/Core.lean` file has module-level docs but individual definitions could use more detailed documentation, especially regarding when to use each profunctor class.

## Rationale
Add comprehensive docstrings to `Profunctor`, `Strong`, `Choice`, `Wandering`, and `Closed` classes with examples and guidance.

Better developer experience, easier onboarding.

## Affected Files
- `Collimator/Core.lean`
